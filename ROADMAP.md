# IT-Support-Universal: Cross-Platform Portable Toolkit

## Vision
Transform our current PowerShell scripts into a universal, portable IT support solution that works seamlessly across all operating systems and hardware architectures without installation requirements.

## Core Concept
A single executable that contains all dependencies, adapts to the host environment, and provides consistent support capabilities regardless of platform - empowering IT professionals to troubleshoot any system from a simple USB drive.

## Technology Stack
- **Core Framework**: Electron.js with Node.js runtime
- **Performance Layer**: WebAssembly (WASM) modules
- **Storage**: Embedded SQLite database
- **Platform-Specific Modules**: Native binaries for deep system integration
- **Self-Contained Packaging**: Complete dependency bundling

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Create basic application architecture
- [ ] Implement cross-platform bootstrapping mechanism
- [ ] Develop platform detection and adaptation system
- [ ] Build modular plugin framework
- [ ] Prototype basic diagnostic capabilities on Windows

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Port existing PowerShell diagnostics to cross-platform architecture
- [ ] Implement hardware inspection modules (CPU, RAM, storage, network)
- [ ] Develop performance monitoring system
- [ ] Create unified reporting engine
- [ ] Build basic user interface with diagnostic dashboard

### Phase 3: Platform Expansion
- [ ] Extend support to macOS (Intel)
- [ ] Add Linux compatibility (Ubuntu/Debian, RHEL/CentOS)
- [ ] Implement ARM architecture support
- [ ] Create platform-specific diagnostic modules
- [ ] Develop universal file system operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add automated system remediation
- [ ] Implement knowledge base system
- [ ] Create historical tracking of system health
- [ ] Develop comparative analysis tools
- [ ] Build network diagnostics and troubleshooting

### Phase 5: Refinement & Distribution
- [ ] Optimize for performance and size
- [ ] Implement automated updates without breaking portability
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Build community contribution framework
- [ ] Establish security scanning and hardening

## Platform Support Targets

| Platform | Architecture | Priority |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Windows 10/11 | x86-64 | High |
| Windows 7/8.1 | x86-64 | Medium |
| Ubuntu/Debian | x86-64 | High |
| RHEL/CentOS | x86-64 | Medium |
| macOS (Intel) | x86-64 | Medium |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | ARM64 | Medium |
| Windows | ARM64 | Low |
| Linux | ARM64/ARM32 | Low |

## User Experience Goals

- **Consistency**: Same workflow and UI across all platforms
- **Simplicity**: Usable by technicians of all skill levels
- **Efficiency**: Quick startup and operation on all systems
- **Autonomy**: No internet connection or external dependencies required
- **Non-Intrusive**: No system modifications or installations

## Technical Challenges

- Creating truly portable binaries for all target platforms
- Maintaining reasonable file size while including all dependencies
- Accessing low-level system information without administrative privileges
- Ensuring security of the packaged application
